ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stevenirby

I'm currently in indiehacker mode, working on https://randomdailyart.com. It's an automated newsletter that runs on a next.js app I built. Along with a go hugo site.
Hacking on other stuff as well.

Typically, for the day job, I work on Python frameworks for the backend and react on the front end. Tech I love: tailwind.css, react, CSS, next.js

I always use TypeScript, even for a small side projects.
