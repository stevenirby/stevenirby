ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stevenirby

I've been working full-time for software companies since 2007. These days, I'm working hard to fix email. 

I run two automated email newsletters:

- https://randomdailyart.com
- https://randomdailyart.ai

Random Daily Art is also a web app for artists to maintain their artists profiles, upload art for the newsletter, see how many times their art has been seen, etc. It's written in TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind.css, and uses the Prisma ORM.

I'm building a browser extension to fixes peoples inboxes: https://unfuck.email


For the day job, I work in Python frameworks such as Django or node.js for the backend and react on the front end. 
Tech I'm using a lot these days: tailwind.css, react, CSS, next.js, alpine.js, prisma, graphql, and more.

I'm looking for freelance opportunities and the right full-time long-term role.
