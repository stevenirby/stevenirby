ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stevenirby

These days, I'm working a lot on AI Agents. 

I work on these projects:

- https://agentscode.dev
- https://aichat.email


I do a lot of work in React, node, serverless lambdas, tailwind/CSS, Next.js, prisma, graphql, and more.

For Python, frameworks such as Django

I'm looking for freelance opportunities and the right full-time, long-term role.
