👋 Hi, I’m @stevenirby

Right now, I'm in the middle of a challenge: 25 projects in 25 weeks. I have to build, ship, and market a new thing every single week. Here's what I've shipped so far this past year:

I work on these projects:

My email newsletter: [Random Daily URLs](https://randomdailyurls.com?ref=github)

I do a lot of work in React, node, serverless lambdas, tailwind/CSS, Next.js, prisma, graphql, and more.

For Python, frameworks such as Django

I'm looking for freelance opportunities and the right full-time, long-term role.
